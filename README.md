# Demo Leaflet Maps in React

I created this pared back version of my final [Ski Resort Finder](https://scottpdawson.com/how-to-create-interactive-maps-with-react-and-leaflet/) project as a resource for anyone wanting to do this on their own. This demo map is super simple, including the ten highest peaks of the Oregon Cascades. Feel free to fork the repo and use it as a basis for your own map development.
